# SeasFire: Earth System Deep Learning for Seasonal Fire Forecasting in Europe

The SeasFire project, funded by the ESA, is taking an innovative approach to predicting seasonal wildfire patterns in Europe. SeasFire uses cutting-edge technology, such as satellite data and deep learning models, to explore the spatio-temporal connections between atmospheric conditions and fire regimes to gain valuable insights into predicting potential wildfires. The project aligns with the ESA's mission to develop innovative applications of Earth Observation data to address important societal and environmental challenges.
